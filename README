This small MD program has implemented a Lennard-Jones potential.

To compile the code use the following command:

gfortran -O2 -o ljmd.x ljmd.F95 --pedantic

This will create the binary ljmd.x, which can be run as follows:

./ljmd.x argon_108.inp

This will override the file argon_108.rest, and create a file called argon_108.xyz.

The file argon_108.xyz can be opened and viewed with VMD.

In the current version, please erase the xyz file between consecutive ljmd.x executions.
